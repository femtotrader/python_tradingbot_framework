Data-access utilities for trading bots.

This subpackage groups helpers that interact with external data sources
or transform raw market/fundamental data into tabular form.

Current contents are thin re-exports from the historical flat `utils`
module layout to avoid a disruptive move:
- `DataService`: unified Yahoo Finance + DB data access
- `load_stock_news_earnings_insider`, `get_portfolio_symbols`: yfinance
  loaders for news, earnings, and insider trades
