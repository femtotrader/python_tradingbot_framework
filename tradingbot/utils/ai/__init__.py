AI utilities for trading bots.

This subpackage exposes a narrow, stable API around the LangChain /
OpenRouter powered helpers used by `Bot.run_ai*` methods.

It is intentionally thin: the heavy lifting still lives in
`tradingbot.utils.aitools`, which remains the single implementation
module. New code should import from `utils.ai` rather than depending
on the concrete LangChain wiring.
